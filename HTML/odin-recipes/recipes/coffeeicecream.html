    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is an attempt to emulate 'Turkish Coffee Ice Cream' made by an ice cream maker in Santa Barbara, California. It comes very close. If you like coffee-flavored ice cream, you'll like this.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely ground coffee (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a saucepan over high heat until the sugar dissolves and the syrup turns clear. Pour into a double boiler along with the cream and milk. Whisk until the syrup has dissolved into the milk, then whisk in the egg yolks and instant coffee until completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>Set the double boiler insert over (but not touching) a pan of gently simmering water. Cook, stirring constantly until the custard has thickened and will stick to the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Pour through a mesh strainer into a bowl and stir in the coffee grounds. Refrigerate several hours until cold.</li>
        <li>Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
    </ol>
